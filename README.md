Library for creating a Solidity file according to the Solidity language grammar.
With this library you can create your own Solidity File without dealing with string interpolations. The library provides easy classes for creating solidity contracts, functions, attributes, variables, modifiers and so on. For almost all the Solidity structures that can be combined, also the relative classes can be combined.
